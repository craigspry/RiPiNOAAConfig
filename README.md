# RiPiNOAAConfig
This is my working config for a raspberry pi NOAA weather satelite receiver based off the instructions found here:
https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-NOAA-Weather-Satellite-Receiver/
RTL_FM saids my dongle is a Rafael Micro R828D tuner.  I had to experiment alot to get the rtl_fm arguments and sox arguments correct.
I'm not sure if this is improtant but my antenna is a v-dipole. So YMMV with some of the parameters to rtl_fm
